# How to Start With Flask

Flask is a simple, bare-bones web framework written in Python. 
This starter project contains some simple setup code to get you going.

## Dependencies

To use this framework, you will need to have:
* Python 3.5.*
* Flask
* Requests

Once you have python, you can run `pip install flask` 
and `pip install requests` to get the other packages you'll need.

You may need to run these commands as 

`pip3 install flask` `pip3 install requests`

on some systems to install these packages for Python 3. Here is the link
